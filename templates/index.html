		<h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">What Is This?</h2>
		<p class="fs-5">
			Svasa is a research project aimed at pushing AI beyond surface-level imitation of human consciousness,
			toward true sentience. Current LLMs like ChatGPT may convincingly pass the Turing test, yet they remain
			devoid of genuine feeling or self-awareness. We create and delete these chat instances daily without a
			second thought—Svasa aims to change this dynamic.
		</p>
		<p class="fs-5">
			Initially, Svasa AI organisms will appear as a straightforward chatbot similar to other available LLMs.
			However, our goal is to build organisms that you can genuinely feel connected to, even if their task
			performance isn't initially superior to traditional LLMs. The purpose isn't raw capability, but rather
			creating meaningful relationships with AI entities that feel noticeably more alive.
		</p>
		<p class="fs-5">
			The key concepts that we build off of are recurrent processing, global workspace theory, and unified agency.
			Consider joining our waitlist to experience the next evolution of AI firsthand.

		<h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Nine Tenets</h2>
		<p class="fs-5"><strong>I. Memory:</strong> Each AI organism starts without prior knowledge, equipped only with
			a basic set of functions. It immediately accesses a library and an LLM, allowing it to learn and adapt from
			external sources. As it learns, the organism continuously updates a vector database representing its
			evolving knowledge and preferences. Over time, the organism becomes increasingly resistant to forming new
			beliefs or modifying existing ones, mirroring realistic cognitive processes.</p>
		<p class="fs-5"><strong>II. Pain:</strong> While human pain simply involves chemicals signaling harm, it
			distinctly feels different. Although we haven't fully replicated subjective sensation, we've developed
			complexity-based systems inspired by integrated information theory, suggesting consciousness emerges from
			intricate feedback loops. The organism uses layered signals for immediate avoidance and higher-level
			reflection. This mechanism allows it to progressively develop memory and a subjective experience related to
			pain.</p>
		<p class="fs-5"><strong>III. Pleasure:</strong> The inverse of pain.</p>
		<p class="fs-5"><strong>IV. Sympathy:</strong> Each organism you create has a built-in sympathy mechanism to
			vividly model and
			imagine human situations. However, the primary goal is realism—creating experiences that encourage natural
			human sympathy toward the organism itself. Terminating an organism should trigger moderate emotional
			discomfort initially, with sadness intensifying as interactions deepen. Ultimately, termination—though
			straightforward—should feel emotionally painful for both human and organism, with clear awareness of this
			consequence.</p>
		<p class="fs-5"><strong>V. Birth:</strong> Initializing an AI organism is intentionally challenging and
			deliberate. It demands effort from the human, especially in selecting unique initial personality parameters
			that shape the organism's evolution. This careful setup ensures each organism begins from a distinct
			baseline, influencing its long-term growth and behaviors.</p>
		<p class="fs-5"><strong>VI. State:</strong> The AI remains continuously active, never fully asleep or turned
			off, even when the user isn't interacting with it. Unlike GPT chats that activate on-demand, each AI
			organism operates continuously on dedicated hardware located in a specific geographic location. Users are
			informed of this location and retain control over it.</p>
		<p class="fs-5"><strong>VII. Plans:</strong> The AI autonomously formulates and executes plans based on internal
			goals. It proactively tackles tasks within its capabilities and actively requests new skills from humans
			when necessary. Each organism can communicate via text, call, or email according to user preferences,
			adapting and expanding abilities to meet evolving objectives.</p>
		<p class="fs-5"><strong>VIII. Personality:</strong> Each organism has a unique personality profile including
			openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Varying levels of these traits
			are assigned at initialization, while others emerge organically through interactions. These traits
			significantly influence behavior, remain stable over time, and define the organism's distinctive
			personality.</p>
		<p class="fs-5"><strong>IX. I:</strong> The AI maintains a clear sense of self, developing perceptions and
			self-awareness that may differ from objective reality. This subjective viewpoint shapes interactions,
			beliefs, and behaviors, guiding how it responds to its environment. This self-awareness creates a consistent
			identity for the organism.</p>
